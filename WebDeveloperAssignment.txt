We'd like you to build a simple to-do app in Ruby on Rails. We expect to be able to add, edit, and remove to-dos, but you're encouraged to be creative and add your own flair. For the purposes of this assignment, we're much more concerned with code quality and usability than design.

Please demonstrate some basic enhancements to the page using JavaScript. For bonus points, consider using a front-end JavaScript framework.

Some specific things we'll be looking for:

- Readable, clean code. For example:
	- Sensible names for classes, methods, variables, and parameters
	- Class and public method documentation
- Good architecture, eg:
	- Adheres to the single responsibility principal
	- DRY code
	- Use of appropriate design patterns
- Conforms to web development best practices:
	- Produces valid HTML & CSS
	- JavaScript runs, and does not product errors
	- Responsive design
	- Basic accessibility
- A fast and functional test suite
- Build, test, and run instructions
- Submitted via a source code repository
